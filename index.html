    <h4>A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device to generate visual feedback.<br> This feedback mostly
      commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset.<br> Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be
      played through teletype printers.<br> Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.</h4>
